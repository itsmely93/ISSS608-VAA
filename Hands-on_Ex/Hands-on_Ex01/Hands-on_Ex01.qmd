# Getting Started

## Installing and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses `p_load()` of the `pacman` package to check if the `tidyverse` packages are installed on the computer. If they are, they will then be loaded into the R environment.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-summary: "Click to show/hide the code"
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

To load the data *"Exam_data"* into the R environment, `read_csv()` is used, as seen in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-summary: "Click to show/hide the code"
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-summary: "Click to show/hide the code"
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, fill=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```
