# Getting Started

## Installing and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of the "pacman" package to check if the "tidyverse" packages are installed on the computer. If they are, they will then be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, fill=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```
